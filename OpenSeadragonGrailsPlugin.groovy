This plugin wraps the openseadragon javascript library. openseadragon is a pure javascript library that allows you
to display, pan, and zoom large images. To this end, images need to be split into tiles. openseadragon supports a number of
formats. In order to include an all java solution here, I produce tiles for the microsoft deep image format using modified code
from https://code.google.com/p/deepjzoom/. Have a look at github for a more detailled description.
